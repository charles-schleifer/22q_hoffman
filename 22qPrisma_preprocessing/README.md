# Overview of 22q Prisma preprocessing steps
Structural and functional scans are preprocessed with a modified version of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipelines [(Glasser et al. 2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23668970/)

This is accomplished with the Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & Toolbox [(QuNex)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2023.1104508/full)
